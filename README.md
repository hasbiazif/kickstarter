## 📌 Overview
Crowdfunding platforms like **Kickstarter** host thousands of creative projects every year.  
In this project, we analyze **639,000+ Kickstarter projects (2025)** to answer:

- 🔮 Can we **predict whether a project will succeed or fail**?
- 📝 What **keywords or categories** are most associated with success?
- 💰 How do funding goals & locations impact project outcomes?

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud  
- **NLP**: TF-IDF, n-grams, logistic regression  
- **ML**: classification models (LogReg, Random Forest, XGBoost)

## 🚀 Goals
1. Perform **EDA** to explore trends in Kickstarter projects.  
2. Apply **data preprocessing** (handling categorical/numerical/text features).  
3. Build & compare **machine learning models**.  
4. Provide **insights & visualizations** useful for creators.

## 📊 Example Insights (to be added)
- Which project categories succeed the most?  
- Do lower funding goals increase the chance of success?  
- How important are **project titles and descriptions**?

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Extend NLP analysis on project descriptions.  
- Deploy best-performing model as a web app (Streamlit).  
- Publish blog post with key findings.
